    <h2> Dua Lipa's mega-hit 'Don't Start Now' grew out of a writing session in Wyoming to achieve world-wide chart domination.
        Producer Ian Kirkpatrick was there from the start. </h2>

    <p>"Many people shit on pop music. They think it's a lesser form of music. But I actually think it's the most mysterious and
        advanced, because you have to make the most amount of people happy. It's like a riddle, and there are no rules. There's
        the Max Martin math and there are other people's approaches, and then there's always something that works that you
        did not think would work. There really are no rules. It's insane."</p>

    Caroline Ailin, Ian Kirkpatrick, Dua Lipa & Emily Warren. Produced by Ian Kirkpatrick." alt="Future Nostalgia">
    <p>
        Talking is Ian Kirkpatrick, one of the
world's most prominent pop music writers and producers. He's recently made many people very happy as the man
behind Dua Lipa's monster hit 'Don't Start Now', which was a number one in close to a dozen countries, and a top 10 in
dozens more. Even more famously, Kirkpatrick was also behind Dua Lipa's iconic 'New Rules' in 2017, which became an
anthem for the then emerging #MeToo movement. In addition, Kirkpatrick has co-written and produced hits for Selena
Gomez, Jason Derulo, Justin Bieber, Nick Jonas and more. </p>
    <p>Despite his impressive track record, Kirkpatrick didn't find it easy to crack the maths: "I didn't know how hard it is to write
        pop music. I remember Mike Caren of APG Music sending me tons of a cappellasof Jason Derulo, asking me to produce
        a track underneath them. I had two years of these opportunities, and I failed every single one. But all that failure made
        me even more obsessed with trying to figure out why my stuff did not sound like what was on the radio. I knew it was a
        reflection of my skill.
    </p>
    <p>"You go in thinking you are good enough, and as soon as you get to the next level, you're at the bottom of the barrel
        again, and competing with everyone else on that level. And the moment you have a song in the charts, you're competing
        with everyone else who has a song in the charts! I did actually have a plan B: I was building websites for money and
        recording local bands. But then I signed to Warner Chappell, and for a long time I didn't get a cut. I became obsessed
        with figuring out why I was not winning, as was my manager, Dan Petel of This Is Noise. We got really good at losing,
        and then we finally won!"
    </p>
    <p> <h2>The Write Stuff</h2>
        Born in Los Angeles 37 years ago, Kirkpatrick started playing drums when he was five. Ten years later a realisation hit
him. "A friend played me a CD by Aphex Twin, and I was blown away by the fact that computers could be used to do
things like that in sound. I was playing in many crappy small bands, and I had no control over what they were doing. If
the music sucked, there was nothing I could change. I was already a bit of a computer nerd, and had no money, but was
on a PC, and so I started looking around for pirated music software. I downloaded a bunch of software, and loved the
fact that I had so much control. I could do every part of the song. I dived in, and started making beats, and set up a small
studio with my now manager.
    </p>
    <p>
    "However, I still thought I was going to do regular studio sessions and be a regular producer. In my early 20s I worked
with many alternative rock bands in that way, doing pre-production and so on. In 2010, I had a hit with a rock band called
Plain White T's ('Rhythm Of Love') and the next year with Breathe Carolina ('Blackout'), and then Mark Wilson signed me
to Warner Chappell. That's when the world of writing for other artists and writing pop opened up for me. Mark started
putting me in sessions with tons of different writers. A few years later, in 2015, I did Jason Derulo's 'Want To Want Me',
and everybody started calling!"
    <p>
Kirkpatrick had successfully made the transition from making music for its own sake to making music for the masses.
"When I was very young," he recalls, "I was making music for me. Then when I started producing others, I was more of a
chameleon, adapting to the band. Then I moved into pop, a genre I was not a big fan of, but it helped that it can
incorporate rock or disco or any kind of genre. I can combine those influences and not always sound the same. Some
people say 'I can tell you produced this,' but I don't think I have an identity. I am still a chameleon, working behind the
scenes and serving the identity of the artist. Everything I do is my interpretation of what I think an artist should do.
    <p>"What motivates me now is believing that a song can do it for everyone, believing that what I'm making is going to be
        liked by everybody. I've been offered a Benny Blanco kind of deal, with me being a producer/artist, and doing songs
        under my name featuring Dua or Selena, but for that I'd need an image and a kind of identifiable sound. And I have no
        idea where to start with that. Would it be disco, or more electronic, like Daft Punk? I don't know. For me all the
        excitement comes from thinking that many people are going to love the song I'm working on, and that it is something
        really smart and new. I can't wait for people to hear it!"

        <h2>Base Camp</h2>
        Kirkpatrick conquers the world from Tarzana, in Los Angeles, where he has a studio in the converted bedroom of a
house he bought two years ago. "I had planned to build a studio in the garage, but old habits die hard, and I prefer the
bedroom environment! I have a Mac with Cubase, with a [UA] Apollo 16 interface, and Barefoot Sound MM27 monitors. I
have a rack of outboard that does not get used all the time, which includes a Shadow Hills Equinox, which I use for
summing and monitoring, two BAE 1084 mic pres, Empirical Labs Distressor compressor, a Thermionic Culture Vulture
mastering and distortion unit, a GML 9500 mastering EQ, and the Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor. I also have a
Kemper modelling amp for guitars. I make tiny slits in foam earplugs and use those to dampen strings I don't play, so I
can focus on just playing two strings!
    <p>"However, I am mostly in the box. I keep it very simple. Less is more. And I adore Steinberg's Cubase. I've used it since
        version SX3. When I was looking for pirated software, I started on Acid, then used Reason, which I still use today, as I do
        with Ableton. I found Cubase at the time as well, and it still is my main DAW, because it feels like flying. It's like an
        extension of my body! And it has functions I have not seen in other DAWs. There's something called the Slide function,
        which is hard to describe, but really useful. Editing is really fast, and the Media Bay, which organises your samples, is
        amazing. I have a decade of rated samples totalling 400GB, and the Media Bay allows me to find things super‑fast. I
        know of no DAW that has something similar that works as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I have met the designers of Cubase, and what I like about their approach is that they're always trying to do new, crazy
        stuff. This can very occasionally result in bugs, but I would rather be an explorer than focus on a company that is only
        concerned about stability. Cubase is stable enough, and I love all the new features. It is so advanced, if you know how to
        use it, and start to think through its endless capabilities, it is really freeing. I feel I can work as fast as I can come up with
        ideas, and I am not limited by anything. But it was tough without playlists — called 'track lists' in Cubase — which it did
        not have for a while. And once Ableton gets playlists, that is going to change things. I wouldn't know how to function
        without playlists.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Other software I use includes Reason, because the synths in it still don't sound like anything else, and I also love all the
         effects. I use it inside Cubase and Ableton. The latter has a few things that are different than Cubase,
         like the sampler is
         really weird and interesting for cutting up stuff and detecting transients. If I'm after a certain 
         sound, I may start a song in
         Ableton, but everything always gets finished in Cubase, before I send stems to the mixer.
    </p>
    <p>"I also use Native Instruments Reaktor, and Razor is my favourite for building bass sounds. Kontakt also is an amazing
        sampler that allows a lot of control over sample manipulation. The Roland Cloud Juno and Jupiter 8 synths are great,
        and the Arturia stuff is really cool. I have tons of stuff. Massive, Addictive Drums, Addictive Keys, Omnisphere, Battery
        for drum programming that's not on the timeline, Massive, GForce M-Tron and Reason".
